  At Ten Thousand Falls Ravine's upper cliff, a late Chosŏn female

  her name because she accompanied a Hamgyŏng governor on his trip.
  Unfortunately, natural erosion and a North Korean political slogan
  have partially destroyed Nanhyang's inscription and many other
  inscriptions adjacent to hers, so we will never know if she had
  male travel companions who carved their names next to hers.
  Nanhyang's inscription is the only pre-1900 autograph graffiti among
  the 4,500 identified found so far at Kŭmgangsan that represents a
  female traveler. Judging from the size
  and calligraphic style of the inscription it most likely dates
  from the late seventeenth to early eighteenth century. This
  signature is one of the very few extant primary source materials
  written directly by a late Chosŏn female entertainer from the
  northern regions of the Korean peninsula and thus provides new
  avenues for research about late Chosŏn period <i>kisaeng</i>.

    Between 1690 and 1790, renowned government-official Yun Saguk 尹師國 (1728-1809) as well as his great-uncle, his father, his son and his nephew had their names carved on a cliff in the northernmost section of Ten Thousand Falls Ravine (Manp’oktong). Yun Saguk passed the <i>munkwa </i> exam in 1759 and served as a high-ranking official in the Chosŏn government from 1760 until his death in 1809. During his time as governor of Kangwŏn Province from 1790 until 1793, he visited Kŭmgangsan several times during his inspection tours. Yun Saguk is primarily known for supporting Buddhist monasteries at Kŭmgangsan by trying to reduce their corvée labor obligations.[<a href="#footnote-1" style={{ color: "orange" }}>

    </a>
    ]{" "} As a renowned calligrapher he is also known for having written the names of Buddhist pilgrimage destinations such as “Myogilsang” and “Samburam” onsite. The fact that male members of his family created a graffiti cluster at Kŭmgangsan is an important discovery that reveals a hitherto unknown socio-cultural aspect of travels by the Yun family.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Yun graffiti cluster consists of three layers. The oldest layer contains the names of Yun Saguk’s great-uncle Yun Chihwa 尹志和 (1660-1704) and Yi Haejo 李海朝 (1660-1711), who traveled to Kŭmgangsan in 1690, as the date below Yun Chihwa’s carved name shows (庚午). Travelers of the second and third layer commissioned the smoothening of the granite, which is extremely unusual for a carving at Kŭmgangsan, and which distinguishes the cluster from the surrounding inscriptions carved on this cliff. The second cluster consists of An Ching 安澂 (d.u.), Yun Kyŏngnyong 尹敬龍 (1686-1743), and Kyŏngnyong’s son Yun Saguk. They visited Kŭmgangsan in 1736 (辰丙) when Kyŏngnyong served as superintendent of Kosan 高山 postal station located approximately 60 miles northwest of Kŭmgangsan
    [<a href="#footnote-1" style={{ color: "orange" }}>
      2
    </a>
    ].{" "} Yun Saguk’s name is part of the second layer, but it is also part of the third and final layer that was added in 1790 (庚戌), when Yun Saguk took his son Yun Chaehŭi 尹載僖 (1754-?) and his nephew Yun Chaesuk 尹載俶 (d.u.) on a trip to Kŭmgangsan shortly after being appointed governor. Yun Saguk ordered local masons to extend the family cluster by smoothening additional rock surface to accommodate his son’s and nephew’s names, and he had the new travel date carved below his name. The ability to create family clusters over the course of several generations was a privilege of renowned aristocratic families (<i>sajok</i>) and reveals their social and cultural capital. This three-layered cluster is a representative example of such travel behavior. It is also one of the very few inscription clusters at Kŭmgangsan that features travel dates for each of its layers.

  Kim Hajong came from a family of renowned court painters. He was the son of Kim Tŭksin 金得臣 (1754-1822) who is well-known for his portrait paintings and genre paintings. Kim Hajong is most famous for an album depicting Kŭmgangsan scenery, the “Album of Sea and Mountains” (Haesan <i>toch’ŏp</i> 海山圖帖). Painted in the style of Kim Hongdo, the album is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum. Due to the fact that this autograph at Angjidae is dated 1870, and because the album reflects a mature painting style, it should probably be dated post-1870 (according to the Metropolitan Museum website it is dated to 1815).[<a href="#footnote-1" style={{ color: "orange" }}>

  Across from Three Buddha Rock (Samburam) is a large boulder with several carvings mimicking the spatial appearance of steles. The inscriptions on these two-dimensional steles commemorate governors, secret envoys and generous aristocratic donors who supported nearby P’yohun Monastery (P’yohunsa) and its subtemples. One of these inscriptions is the “Stele to honor the virtue of Yŏngmyŏngwi Hong Hyŏnju, Mujin (1868)” (永明尉大監洪公顯周 善政碑 戊辰). Yŏngmyŏngwi was the title conferred to central elite Hong Hyŏnju 洪顯周 (1793–1865) upon his marriage with Princess Suksŏn (Suksŏn ongju 淑善翁主) during his teenage years.{" "}
</p>
<p>
  Contrary to the poem that Hong Hyŏnju carved on one of the river boulders at Ten Thousand Falls Ravine (Manp’oktong) when he visited Kŭmgangsan sometime during the first half of the nineteenth century, the stele inscription at Samburam was not carved by Hong himself.[<a href="#footnote-1" style={{ color: "orange" }}>
    1
  </a>
] It was carved in 1868, three years after Hong’s death, at the conclusion of ten memorial rites performed by the P’yohunsa monks in order to pray for Hong’s well-being in the afterlife. With the carving of this stele the monks publicly highlighted a central elite family’s support, which brought prestige to their monastery and potentially attracted new donors. Hong Hyŏnju belonged to the Hong Yŏng 洪霙 descent line of the P’ungsan 豊山 Hong clan, which had supported P’yohunsa since at least 1818, when shortly after Hyŏnju’s marriage a prayer text was submitted to Podŏk Hermitage to pray for the newlywed’s well-being and abundant descendants. The text was composed by Hong Hyŏnju’s elder brother and high-ranking government official Hong Sŏkchu 洪奭周 (1774-1842) and written by Yi Kigyŏng 李基慶 (1756-1819).[<a href="#footnote-1" style={{ color: "orange" }}>

<p>
This stele inscription constitutes valuable evidence for members of a Hansŏng-based elite clan supporting a Buddhist monastery in eighteenth-century Korea, questioning the modern narrative that the Chosŏn elite was “anti-Buddhist” due to their adherence to Neo-Confucian statecraft and ideology.

  AAOK is a digital project based on the collection, organization,
  selection, editing, and analysis of more than 5,500 autographic
  inscriptions, which project director Maya Stiller discovered and
  photographed during field research in North and South Korea between
  2008 and 2017. From 2015 through 2018 she identified, transcribed and
  catalogued the original Chinese characters of these names (many of
  them barely legible) in a relational database. Prosopographical
  research of the inscriptions between 2015 and 2019 led to the
  selection and organization of this material into single inscriptions
  and cluster inscriptions, the latter of which were again divided into
  agnatic clusters and associative clusters. The print publication
  Carving Status at Kŭmgangsan: Elite Graffiti in Premodern Korea
  published by University of Washington Press in 2021 is Maya Stiller’s
  pioneering study about Korean autographs, in which she explains the
  historical development and structural features of Kŭmgangsan’s
  autographic inscriptions. Carving Status at Kŭmgangsan and AAOK
  complement each other well in both content and analysis. They are each
  based on Maya Stiller’s research of autographic inscriptions, but
  while Carving Status at Kŭmgangsan provides an in-depth analysis of
  the inscriptions’ historical context, AAOK is a digital platform for
  scholars to interactively engage with the material and research the
  entire corpus (including inscriptions not discussed in the book) using
  specific search queries.
</p>
<p>
  During the academic year 2019-20, Maya Stiller conceptualized the
  website design and structure, which were informed by the results of
  the aforementioned prosopographical research. For example, research
  showed that Kŭmgangsan’s autographs are concentrated in six locations.
  Hence, AAOK’s spatial analysis tool focuses on these locations. The
  range of keywords provided in the AAOK filtered search engine are the
  keywords generated during the inscription analysis process. During
  2019-20, Maya Stiller also experimented with a number of platforms
  such as Omeka and Esri Storytelling, and used templates provided by
  Wordpress and Joomla to create the AAOK website design. Eventually, it
  was determined that none of the platforms or content management systems (CMS) could provide
  AAOK’s signature features envisioned to help users explore and
  research Korea’s autographic inscriptions. After more research into
  web applications and languages such as PHP, Python, and C#, an earlier version of the
  current website was created on Heroku in December 2020 using React.js,
  an open-source JavaScript library.
</p>
<p>
  During the academic year of 2020-21, summer 2021, and fall 2021, Maya Stiller and Nyla Chaudhry built a comprehensive relational database with metadata about 4,500 Kŭmgangsan travelers’ inscriptions and metadata about 1,200 high-resolution images. Prior to embarking on this arduous task, Maya Stiller and Adam Wallace designed a SQL table key for 18 tables, each of which consists of a group of multiple columns and hundreds (sometimes thousands) of rows. This level of information separation was necessary in order to make the relational data machine-readable. These 18 tables form the backbone of the search engine featured on the AAOK website. Some of these tables contain more than 4,500 rows and over 30 columns and are written in Korean (romanized), Korean (han’gŭl), Sinitic characters, and English. Not only did it take several months to develop these tables, but the team also spent a considerable amount of time defining rules for the entering of data, which resulted in some exciting discoveries. Following the logging of the entries, the information had to be verified, cleaned, and modified in three distinct languages. Based on this groundbreaking work, AAOK’s specialized search engine now enables users to retrieve information from the SQL server databases using meta-data search queries, including relational data about 4,500 individuals and their agnatic and associative relationships, their government positions, exams, and social status, as well as spatial data about their inscriptions such as the locations and clustering of their inscriptions.
</p>
<p>
  In spring and summer 2021, Maya Stiller also worked with Adam Wallace on the design and implementation of the search engine structure, the creation of some mock-up search results, and refinement of the search framework. Maya Stiller also wrote a “Help Guide” for the search engine. Adam Wallace continued his work of coding to create the webpages; deploying them to the new webserver; and linking data stored on the SQL server to the website’s search engine. In summer and fall 2021, Maya Stiller and Adam Wallace partnered with KU IT to run multiple security checks and configurations in order to migrate the privately hosted AAOK website to a KU-based webserver and connect the website with a KU-based SQL server. This part of the project was completed in December 2021. In December 2021/January 2022, our new team member, Shankar Ambati, deployed an updated version to the webserver with new graffiti spotlight entries, Kŭmgangsan maps, and images, which Maya Stiller had created during summer 2021.
</p>
<p>
Currently the team works on cleaning, maintaining, and completing the database material and
improving the visual presentation of search queries and metadata analysis results. While the current version of AAOK focuses on inscriptions collected at Kŭmgangsan, inscriptions from other locations have been transcribed and researched and will be added to the website during the next project stage.

  This project was supported by an Academy of Korean Studies Research Grant (AKS-2020-R19), a research fund from the Department of Art History at the University of Kansas, and a Research Excellence Initiative (REI) Time-Sensitive and Urgency Fund (TSU) from the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences at the University of Kansas.

  Welcome to the Autographic Atlas of Korea (AAOK), a digital resource and
  search engine for locating and studying thousands of inscriptions carved
  into the rocks and boulders of travel destinations in Korea.
  The underlying argument of AAOK is that autographic inscriptions were
  written and carved on boulders near pavilions, waterfalls, and Buddhist
  temples as a method of constructing social memory.
</p>
<p>
  Use the following two features to explore primarily pre-modern Korean rock graffiti:
  <br />
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>
      The spatial exploration tool through which you can explore
      autographs in their geographical setting.
    </li>
    <li>
      The filtered search feature to search specifically for a
      category of graffiti (single, cluster) or social class of travelers
      (elite, chungin, non-elite), and/or combine filters, selecting from
      a number of search options such as official rank, time of travel,
      points of departure, etc.
    </li>
  </ul>

University of Kansas. She began her Digital Humanities journey in
2010 as a graduate student at UCLA, where Yoh Kawano taught her the
nuts and bolts of historical GIS at the GIS and Visualization
Sandbox. Since then she has created historical GIS-based maps that
have informed her research and teaching (and are also featured on
AAOK). The AAOK website is based on Stiller’s research on autographic
rock inscriptions in Korea. In collaboration with Adam Wallace, Maya Stiller developed the website’s framework and built the search engine structure; with Jeongwon Yoon’s assistance, she authored the explanatory texts in English and Korean. Maya Stiller also created the maps and curated the images featured in the “Kŭmgangsan online travel” section on the website. Most importantly, in collaboration with Nyla Chaudhry, she built and curated a comprehensive relational database that contains the metadata of 4,500 individual travelers and the metadata of 1,200 photographs.</>);
